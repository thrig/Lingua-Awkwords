=head1 NAME

Lingua::Awkwords::OneOf - random choice from a list of items

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is not typically used directly, as it will be created
and called as part of the pattern parse and then render phases of
other code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container object for a list of items; upon B<render> one of these items
will be picked at random and have B<render> called on it. Whatever that
returns will be returned, minus whatever any filters may remove.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item I<filters>

List of filters, if any. Use B<add_filters> to set these.

=item I<filter_with>

String to replaced filtered values with, the empty string by default.

=item I<picker>

Where the L<Math::Random::Discrete> object to provide weighted random
choices is stored.

=item I<terms>

Choices are stored here as an array reference.

=item I<weights>

List of weights for each of the choices.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<add_choice> I<value> I<weight>

Adds the given I<value> and its I<weight> to the choices.

=item B<add_filters> I<filter> ..

Adds one or more strings as a filter for the B<render> phase. These
limit what a unit can generate, e.g. C<[x/y/z]^x> would replace a result
of C<x> with the empty string.

=item B<clear_picker>

This is used by the B<add> method to invalidate the picker object; call
this method if you have manually fiddled with the I<alts> or I<weights>
after making a B<render> call.

=item B<new>

Constructor.

=item B<render>

Picks a random choice and in turn calls B<render> on that, then applies
any filters present on that result.

=item B<walk> I<callback>

Calls the I<callback> function with itself as the argument, then calls
B<walk> on all of the available choices.
