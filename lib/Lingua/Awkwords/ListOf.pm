=head1 NAME

Lingua::Awkwords::ListOf - container for a list of items

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is not typically used directly, as it will be created
and called as part of the pattern parse and then render phases of
other code.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Container object for a list of items; upon B<render> these items will
each have B<render> call on them and that concatenated result (minus
anything excluded by filters) will be returned as a string.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 4

=item I<filters>

List of filters, if any.

=item I<filter_with>

String to replaced filtered values with, the empty string by default.

=item I<terms>

Items of the list are held here as an array reference.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<add> I<value> ..

Adds the given list of I<value> to the I<terms>.

=item B<add_filters> I<filter> ..

Adds one or more strings as a filter for the B<render> phase. These
limit what a unit can generate e.g. to remove repeated vowels from a
C<[VV]> pattern via C<[VV]^aa>.

=item B<new>

Constructor.

=item B<render>

Calls B<render> on turn on each item in the I<terms> list, joins those
results together, applies any filters, and returns that string result.

=item B<walk> I<callback>

Calls the I<callback> function with itself as the argument, then calls
B<walk> on all of the available I<terms>.
